Linked to the Least Performing of the Nasdaq-100® Index, the Russell 2000® Index and the S&P 500® Index

•     The Contingent Income Issuer Callable Yield Notes Linked to the Least Performing of the Nasdaq-100® Index, the Russell 2000® Index and the S&P 500® Index, due April 29, 2026 (the

“Notes”) priced on April 24, 2024 and will issue on April 29, 2024.

•     Approximate 2 year term if not called prior to maturity.
•     Payments on the Notes will depend on the individual performance of the Nasdaq-100® Index, the Russell 2000® Index and the S&P 500® Index (each an “Underlying”).
•     Contingent coupon rate of 8.00% per annum (2.00% per quarter) payable quarterly if the closing level of each Underlying on the applicable Observation Date is greater than or equal to

70.00% of its Starting Value, assuming the Notes have not been called.

•     Beginning on October 29, 2024, callable quarterly at our option for an amount equal to the principal amount plus the relevant Contingent Coupon Payment, if otherwise payable.
•     Assuming the Notes are not called prior to maturity, if any Underlying declines by more than 35% from its Starting Value, at maturity your investment will be subject to 1:1 downside
exposure to decreases in the value of the Least Performing Underlying, with up to 100% of the principal at risk; otherwise, at maturity, you will receive the principal amount. At maturity
you will also receive a final Contingent Coupon Payment if the closing level of each Underlying on the final Observation Date is greater than or equal to 70.00% of its Starting Value.
•     All payments on the Notes are subject to the credit risk of BofA Finance LLC (“BofA Finance” or the “Issuer”), as issuer of the Notes, and Bank of America Corporation (“BAC” or the

“Guarantor”), as guarantor of the Notes.

•     The Notes will not be listed on any securities exchange.
•     CUSIP No. 09711BQ25.

The initial estimated value of the Notes as of the pricing date is $966.80 per $1,000.00 in principal amount of Notes, which is less than the public offering price listed below. The actual
value of your Notes at any time will reflect many factors and cannot be predicted with accuracy. See “Risk Factors” beginning on page PS-9 of this pricing supplement and “Structuring the Notes” on
page PS-24 of this pricing supplement for additional information.
There are important differences between the Notes and a conventional debt security. Potential purchasers of the Notes should consider the information in “Risk Factors” beginning on
page  PS-9  of  this  pricing  supplement,  page  PS-5  of  the  accompanying  product  supplement,  page  S-6  of  the  accompanying  prospectus  supplement,  and  page  7  of  the  accompanying

Underlying Return:

With respect to each Underlying,

Least Performing Underlying:

The Underlying with the lowest Underlying Return.

Events of Default and Acceleration:

If an Event of Default, as defined in the senior indenture relating to the Notes and in the section entitled “Description of Debt Securities of BofA Finance LLC—
Events of Default and Rights of Acceleration; Covenant Breaches” on page 54 of the accompanying prospectus, with respect to the Notes occurs and is
continuing, the amount payable to a holder of the Notes upon any acceleration permitted under the senior indenture will be equal to the amount described
under the caption “Redemption Amount” above, calculated as though the date of acceleration were the Maturity Date of the Notes and as though the Valuation
Date were the third Trading Day prior to the date of acceleration. We will also determine whether a final Contingent Coupon Payment is payable based upon
the levels of the Underlyings on the deemed Valuation Date; any such final Contingent Coupon Payment will be prorated by the calculation agent to reflect the
length of the final contingent payment period. In case of a default in the payment of the Notes, whether at their maturity or upon acceleration, the Notes will not
bear a default interest rate.

Any payments on the Notes depend on the credit risk of BofA Finance, as Issuer, and BAC, as Guarantor, and on the performance of the Underlyings. The economic terms of the Notes are based on
BAC’s internal funding rate, which is the rate it would pay to borrow funds through the issuance of market-linked notes, and the economic terms of certain related hedging arrangements BAC’s affiliates
enter into. BAC’s internal funding rate is typically lower than the rate it would pay when it issues conventional fixed or floating rate debt securities. This difference in funding rate, as well as the
underwriting discount, if any, and the hedging related charges described below (see “Risk Factors” beginning on page PS-9), reduced the economic terms of the Notes to you and the initial estimated
value of the Notes. Due to these factors, the public offering price you are paying to purchase the Notes is greater than the initial estimated value of the Notes as of the pricing date.

The initial estimated value of the Notes as of the pricing date is set forth on the cover page of this pricing supplement. For more information about the initial estimated value and the structuring of the
Notes, see “Risk Factors” beginning on page PS-9 and “Structuring the Notes” on page PS-24.

Hypothetical Payout Profile and Examples of Payments at Maturity

Contingent Income Issuer Callable Yield Notes Table

The following table is for purposes of illustration only. It assumes the Notes have not been called prior to maturity and is based on hypothetical values and shows hypothetical returns on the Notes.
The table illustrates the calculation of the Redemption Amount and the return on the Notes based on a hypothetical Starting Value of 100 for the Least Performing Underlying, a hypothetical Coupon
Barrier of 70 for the Least Performing Underlying, a hypothetical Threshold Value of 65 for the Least Performing Underlying, the Contingent Coupon Payment of $20.00 per $1,000.00 in principal
amount of Notes and a range of hypothetical Ending Values of the Least Performing Underlying. The actual amount you receive and the resulting return will depend on the actual Starting Values,
Coupon Barriers, Threshold Values, Observation Values and Ending Values of the Underlyings, whether the Notes are called prior to maturity, and whether you hold the Notes to maturity.
The following examples do not take into account any tax consequences from investing in the Notes.

For recent actual values of the Underlyings, see “The Underlyings” section below. The Ending Value of each Underlying will not include any income generated by dividends or other distributions paid
with respect to shares or units of that Underlying or on the securities included in that Underlying, as applicable. In addition, all payments on the Notes are subject to Issuer and Guarantor credit risk.

Risk Factors

Your investment in the Notes entails significant risks, many of which differ from those of a conventional debt security. Your decision to purchase the Notes should be made only after carefully
considering the risks of an investment in the Notes, including those discussed below, with your advisors in light of your particular circumstances. The Notes are not an appropriate investment for you if
you are not knowledgeable about significant elements of the Notes or financial matters in general. You should carefully review the more detailed explanation of risks relating to the Notes in the “Risk
Factors” sections beginning on page PS-5 of the accompanying product supplement, page S-6 of the accompanying prospectus supplement and page 7 of the accompanying prospectus, each as
identified on page PS-28 below.

Structure-related Risks

•     Your investment may result in a loss; there is no guaranteed return of principal. There is no fixed principal repayment amount on the Notes at maturity. If the Notes are not called
prior to maturity and the Ending Value of any Underlying is less than its Threshold Value, at maturity, your investment will be subject to 1:1 downside exposure to decreases in the value
of the Least Performing Underlying and you will lose 1% of the principal amount for each 1% that the Ending Value of the Least Performing Underlying is less than its Starting Value. In
that case, you will lose a significant portion or all of your investment in the Notes.

•     Your return on the Notes is limited to the return represented by the Contingent Coupon Payments, if any, over the term of the Notes. Your return on the Notes is limited to the
Contingent Coupon Payments paid over the term of the Notes, regardless of the extent to which the Observation Value or Ending Value of any Underlying exceeds its Coupon Barrier or
Starting Value, as applicable. Similarly, the amount payable at maturity or upon an Optional Early Redemption will never exceed the sum of the principal amount and the applicable
Contingent Coupon Payment, regardless of the extent to which the Observation Value or Ending Value of any Underlying exceeds its Starting Value. In contrast, a direct investment in the
securities included in one or more of the Underlyings would allow you to receive the benefit of any appreciation in their values. Any return on the Notes will not reflect the return you
would realize if you actually owned those securities and received the dividends paid or distributions made on them.

•     The Notes are subject to Optional Early Redemption, which would limit your ability to receive the Contingent Coupon Payments over the full term of the Notes. On each Call
Payment Date, at our option, we may call your Notes in whole, but not in part. If the Notes are called prior to the Maturity Date, you will be entitled to receive the Early Redemption
Amount on the applicable Call Payment Date, and no further amounts will be payable on the Notes. In this case, you will lose the opportunity to continue to receive Contingent Coupon
Payments after the date of the Optional Early Redemption. If the Notes are called prior to the Maturity Date, you may be unable to invest in other securities with a similar level of risk that
could provide a return that is similar to the Notes. Even if we do not exercise our option to call your Notes, our ability to do so may adversely affect the market value of your Notes. It is
our sole option whether to call your Notes prior to maturity on any such Call Payment Date and we may or may not exercise this option for any reason. Because of this Optional Early
Redemption potential, the term of your Notes could be anywhere between six and twenty-four months.

•     You may not receive any Contingent Coupon Payments. The Notes do not provide for any regular fixed coupon payments. Investors in the Notes will not necessarily receive any
Contingent Coupon Payments on the Notes. If the Observation Value of any Underlying is less than its Coupon Barrier on an Observation Date, you will not receive the Contingent
Coupon Payment applicable to that Observation Date. If the Observation Value of any Underlying is less than its Coupon Barrier on all the Observation Dates during the term of the
Notes, you will not receive any Contingent Coupon Payments during the term of the Notes, and will not receive a positive return on the Notes.

•     Your return on the Notes may be less than the yield on a conventional debt security of comparable maturity. Any return that you receive on the Notes may be less than the return
you would earn if you purchased a conventional debt security with the same Maturity Date. As a result, your investment in the Notes may not reflect the full opportunity cost to you when
you consider factors, such as inflation, that affect the time value of money. In addition, if interest rates increase during the term of the Notes, the Contingent Coupon Payment (if any) may
be less than the yield on a conventional debt security of comparable maturity.

•     The Contingent Coupon Payment, Early Redemption Amount or Redemption Amount, as applicable, will not reflect changes in the levels of the Underlyings other than on
the Observation Dates. The levels of the Underlyings during the term of the Notes other than on the Observation Dates will not affect payments on the Notes. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, investors should generally be aware of the performance of the Underlyings while holding the Notes, as the performance of the Underlyings may influence the market value of
the Notes. The calculation agent will determine whether each Contingent Coupon Payment is payable and will calculate the Early Redemption Amount or the Redemption Amount, as
applicable, by comparing only the Starting Value, the Coupon Barrier or the Threshold Value, as applicable, to the Observation Value or the Ending Value for each Underlying. No other
levels of the Underlyings will be taken into account. As a result, if the Notes are not called prior to maturity and the Ending Value of the Least Performing Underlying is less than its
Threshold Value, you will receive less than the principal amount at maturity even if the level of each Underlying was always above its Threshold Value prior to the Valuation Date.
•     Because the Notes are linked to the least performing (and not the average performance) of the Underlyings, you may not receive any return on the Notes and may lose a
significant portion or all of your investment in the Notes even if the Observation Value or Ending Value of one Underlying is greater than or equal to its Coupon Barrier or
Threshold Value, as applicable. Your Notes are linked to the least performing of the Underlyings, and a change in the level of one Underlying may not correlate with changes in the
levels of the other Underlyings. The Notes are not linked to a basket composed of the Underlyings, where the depreciation in the level

        of one Underlying could be offset to some extent by the appreciation in the levels of the other Underlyings. In the case of the Notes, the individual performance of each Underlying would
not be combined, and the depreciation in the level of one Underlying would not be offset by any appreciation in the levels of the other Underlyings. Even if the Observation Value of an
Underlying is at or above its Coupon Barrier on an Observation Date, you will not receive the Contingent Coupon Payment with respect to that Observation Date if the Observation Value
of another Underlying is below its Coupon Barrier on that day. In addition, even if the Ending Value of an Underlying is at or above its Threshold Value, you will lose a significant portion
or all of your investment in the Notes if the Ending Value of the Least Performing Underlying is below its Threshold Value.

•     Any payments on the Notes are subject to our credit risk and the credit risk of the Guarantor, and any actual or perceived changes in our or the Guarantor’s

creditworthiness are expected to affect the value of the Notes. The Notes are our senior unsecured debt securities. Any payment on the Notes will be fully and unconditionally
guaranteed by the Guarantor. The Notes are not guaranteed by any entity other than the Guarantor. As a result, your receipt of any payments on the Notes will be dependent upon our
ability and the ability of the Guarantor to repay our respective obligations under the Notes on the applicable payment date, regardless of the performance of the Underlyings. No
assurance can be given as to what our financial condition or the financial condition of the Guarantor will be at any time after the pricing date of the Notes. If we and the Guarantor
become unable to meet our respective financial obligations as they become due, you may not receive the amount payable under the terms of the Notes.

In addition, our credit ratings and the credit ratings of the Guarantor are assessments by ratings agencies of our respective abilities to pay our obligations. Consequently, our or the
Guarantor’s perceived creditworthiness and actual or anticipated decreases in our or the Guarantor’s credit ratings or increases in the spread between the yield on our respective
securities and the yield on U.S. Treasury securities (the “credit spread”) prior to the Maturity Date may adversely affect the market value of the Notes. However, because your return on
the Notes depends upon factors in addition to our ability and the ability of the Guarantor to pay our respective obligations, such as the values of the Underlyings, an improvement in our
or the Guarantor’s credit ratings will not reduce the other investment risks related to the Notes.

•     We are a finance subsidiary and, as such, have no independent assets, operations, or revenues. We are a finance subsidiary of the Guarantor, have no operations other than
those related to the issuance, administration and repayment of our debt securities that are guaranteed by the Guarantor, and are dependent upon the Guarantor and/or its other
subsidiaries to meet our obligations under the Notes in the ordinary course. Therefore, our ability to make payments on the Notes may be limited.

Valuation and Market-related Risks

•     The public offering price you are paying for the Notes exceeds their initial estimated value. The initial estimated value of the Notes that is provided on the cover page of this

pricing supplement is an estimate only, determined as of the pricing date by reference to our and our affiliates’ pricing models. These pricing models consider certain assumptions and
variables, including our credit spreads and those of the Guarantor, the Guarantor’s internal funding rate, mid-market terms on hedging transactions, expectations on interest rates,
dividends and volatility, price-sensitivity analysis, and the expected term of the Notes. These pricing models rely in part on certain forecasts about future events, which may prove to be
incorrect. If you attempt to sell the Notes prior to maturity, their market value may be lower than the price you paid for them and lower than their initial estimated value. This is due to,
among other things, changes in the levels of the Underlyings, changes in the Guarantor’s internal funding rate, and the inclusion in the public offering price of the underwriting discount, if
any, and the hedging related charges, all as further described in “Structuring the Notes” below. These factors, together with various credit, market and economic factors over the term of
the Notes, are expected to reduce the price at which you may be able to sell the Notes in any secondary market and will affect the value of the Notes in complex and unpredictable ways.
•     The initial estimated value does not represent a minimum or maximum price at which we, BAC, BofAS or any of our other affiliates would be willing to purchase your Notes
in any secondary market (if any exists) at any time. The value of your Notes at any time after issuance will vary based on many factors that cannot be predicted with accuracy,
including the performance of the Underlyings, our and BAC’s creditworthiness and changes in market conditions.

•     We cannot assure you that a trading market for your Notes will ever develop or be maintained. We will not list the Notes on any securities exchange. We cannot predict how the

Notes will trade in any secondary market or whether that market will be liquid or illiquid.

Conflict-related Risks

•     Trading and hedging activities by us, the Guarantor and any of our other affiliates, including BofAS, may create conflicts of interest with you and may affect your return on
the Notes and their market value. We, the Guarantor or one or more of our other affiliates, including BofAS, may buy or sell the securities held by or included in the Underlyings, or
futures or options contracts or exchange traded instruments on the Underlyings or those securities, or other instruments whose value is derived from the Underlyings or those securities.
While we, the Guarantor or one or more of our other affiliates, including BofAS, may from time to time own securities represented by the Underlyings, except to the extent that BAC’s
common stock may be included in the Underlyings, we, the Guarantor and our other affiliates, including BofAS, do not control any company included in the Underlyings, and have not
verified any disclosure made by any other company. We, the Guarantor or one or more of our other affiliates, including BofAS, may execute such purchases or sales for our own or their
own accounts, for business reasons, or in connection with hedging our obligations under the Notes. These transactions may present a conflict of interest between your interest in the
Notes and the interests we, the Guarantor and our other

        affiliates, including BofAS, may have in our or their proprietary accounts, in facilitating transactions, including block trades, for our or their other customers, and in accounts under our or
their management. These transactions may adversely affect the levels of the Underlyings in a manner that could be adverse to your investment in the Notes. On or before the pricing
date, any purchases or sales by us, the Guarantor or our other affiliates, including BofAS or others on our or their behalf (including those for the purpose of hedging some or all of our
anticipated exposure in connection with the Notes), may have affected the levels of the Underlyings. Consequently, the levels of the Underlyings may change subsequent to the pricing
date, which may adversely affect the market value of the Notes.

We, the Guarantor or one or more of our other affiliates, including BofAS, also may have engaged in hedging activities that could have affected the levels of the Underlyings on the
pricing date. In addition, these hedging activities, including the unwinding of a hedge, may decrease the market value of your Notes prior to maturity, and may affect the amounts to be
paid on the Notes. We, the Guarantor or one or more of our other affiliates, including BofAS, may purchase or otherwise acquire a long or short position in the Notes and may hold or
resell the Notes. For example, BofAS may enter into these transactions in connection with any market making activities in which it engages. We cannot assure you that these activities
will not adversely affect the levels of the Underlyings, the market value of your Notes prior to maturity or the amounts payable on the Notes.

•     There may be potential conflicts of interest involving the calculation agent, which is an affiliate of ours. We have the right to appoint and remove the calculation agent. One of our
affiliates will be the calculation agent for the Notes and, as such, will make a variety of determinations relating to the Notes, including the amounts that will be paid on the Notes. Under
some circumstances, these duties could result in a conflict of interest between its status as our affiliate and its responsibilities as calculation agent.

Underlying-related Risks

•     The Notes are subject to risks associated with small-size capitalization companies. The stocks comprising the RTY are issued by companies with small-sized market capitalization.
The stock prices of small-size companies may be more volatile than stock prices of large capitalization companies. Small-size capitalization companies may be less able to withstand
adverse economic, market, trade and competitive conditions relative to larger companies. Small-size capitalization companies may also be more susceptible to adverse developments
related to their products or services.

•     The Notes are subject to risks associated with foreign securities markets. The NDX includes certain foreign equity securities. You should be aware that investments in securities
linked to the value of foreign equity securities involve particular risks. The foreign securities markets comprising the NDX may have less liquidity and may be more volatile than U.S. or
other securities markets and market developments may affect foreign markets differently from U.S. or other securities markets. Direct or indirect government intervention to stabilize
these foreign securities markets, as well as cross-shareholdings in foreign companies, may affect trading prices and volumes in these markets. Also, there is generally less publicly
available information about foreign companies than about those U.S. companies that are subject to the reporting requirements of the SEC, and foreign companies are subject to
accounting, auditing and financial reporting standards and requirements that differ from those applicable to U.S. reporting companies. Prices of securities in foreign countries are subject
to political, economic, financial and social factors that apply in those geographical regions. These factors, which could negatively affect those securities markets, include the possibility of
recent or future changes in a foreign government’s economic and fiscal policies, the possible imposition of, or changes in, currency exchange laws or other laws or restrictions applicable
to foreign companies or investments in foreign equity securities and the possibility of fluctuations in the rate of exchange between currencies, the possibility of outbreaks of hostility and
political instability and the possibility of natural disaster or adverse public health developments in the region. Moreover, foreign economies may differ favorably or unfavorably from the
U.S. economy in important respects such as growth of gross national product, rate of inflation, capital reinvestment, resources and self-sufficiency.

•     The publisher or the sponsor of an Underlying may adjust that Underlying in a way that affects its levels, and the publisher or the sponsor has no obligation to consider
your interests. The publisher or the sponsor of an Underlying can add, delete, or substitute the components included in that Underlying or make other methodological changes that
could change its level. Any of these actions could adversely affect the value of your Notes.

Tax-related Risks

•     The U.S. federal income tax consequences of an investment in the Notes are uncertain, and may be adverse to a holder of the Notes. No statutory, judicial, or administrative
authority directly addresses the characterization of the Notes or securities similar to the Notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes. As a result, significant aspects of the U.S. federal
income tax consequences of an investment in the Notes are not certain. Under the terms of the Notes, you will have agreed with us to treat the Notes as contingent income-bearing
single financial contracts, as described below under “U.S. Federal Income Tax Summary—General.” If the Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) were successful in asserting an
alternative characterization for the Notes, the timing and character of income, gain or loss with respect to the Notes may differ. No ruling will be requested from the IRS with respect to
the Notes and no assurance can be given that the IRS will agree with the statements made in the section entitled “U.S. Federal Income Tax Summary.” You are urged to consult with
your own tax advisor regarding all aspects of the U.S. federal income tax consequences of investing in the Notes.

The Underlyings

All disclosures contained in this pricing supplement regarding the Underlyings, including, without limitation, their make-up, method of calculation, and changes in their components, have been derived
from publicly available sources. The information reflects the policies of, and is subject to change by, the sponsor of the NDX, the sponsor of the RTY and the sponsor of the SPX (collectively, the
“Underlying Sponsors”). The Underlying Sponsors, which license the copyright and all other rights to the respective Underlyings, have no obligation to continue to publish, and may discontinue
publication of, the Underlyings. The consequences of any Underlying Sponsor discontinuing publication of the applicable Underlying are discussed in “Description of the Notes — Discontinuance of an
Index” in the accompanying product supplement. None of us, the Guarantor, the calculation agent, or BofAS accepts any responsibility for the calculation, maintenance or publication of any Underlying
or any successor index. None of us, the Guarantor, BofAS or any of our other affiliates makes any representation to you as to the future performance of the Underlyings. You should make your own
investigation into the Underlyings.

The Nasdaq-100® Index

The NDX is intended to measure the performance of the 100 largest domestic and international non-financial securities listed on The Nasdaq Stock Market ("NASDAQ") based on market capitalization.
The NDX reflects companies across major industry groups including computer hardware and software, telecommunications, retail/wholesale trade and biotechnology. It does not contain securities of
financial companies including investment companies.

The NDX began trading on January 31, 1985 at a base value of 125.00. The NDX is calculated and published by Nasdaq, Inc. In administering the NDX, Nasdaq, Inc. will exercise reasonable discretion
as it deems appropriate.

Underlying Stock Eligibility Criteria

NDX eligibility is limited to specific security types only. The security types eligible for the NDX include foreign or domestic common stocks, ordinary shares, ADRs and tracking stocks. Security types not
included in the NDX are closed-end funds, convertible debt securities, exchange traded funds, limited liability companies, limited partnership interests, preferred stocks, rights, shares or units of
beneficial interest, warrants, units, and other derivative securities. The NDX does not contain securities of investment companies. For purposes of the NDX eligibility criteria, if the security is a
depositary receipt representing a security of a non-U.S. issuer, then references to the “issuer” are references to the issuer of the underlying security.

Initial Eligibility Criteria

To be eligible for initial inclusion in the NDX, a security must be listed on NASDAQ and meet the following criteria:

•     the security’s U.S. listing must be exclusively on the Nasdaq Global Select Market or the Nasdaq Global Market (unless the security was dually listed on another U.S. market prior to

January 1, 2004 and has continuously maintained such listing);

•     the security must be of a non-financial company;
•     the security may not be issued by an issuer currently in bankruptcy proceedings;
•     the security must have a minimum three-month average daily trading volume of at least 200,000 shares;
•     if the issuer of the security is organized under the laws of a jurisdiction outside the U.S., then such security must have listed options on a recognized options market in the U.S. or be

eligible for listed-options trading on a recognized options market in the U.S.;

•     the issuer of the security may not have entered into a definitive agreement or other arrangement which would likely result in the security no longer being eligible for inclusion in the NDX;
•     the issuer of the security may not have annual financial statements with an audit opinion that is currently withdrawn; and
•     the issuer of the security must have “seasoned” on NASDAQ, the New York Stock Exchange or NYSE Amex. Generally, a company is considered to be seasoned if it has been listed on

a market for at least three full months (excluding the first month of initial listing).

Continued Eligibility Criteria

In addition, to be eligible for continued inclusion in the NDX, the following criteria apply:

•     the security’s U.S. listing must be exclusively on the Nasdaq Global Select Market or the Nasdaq Global Market;
•     the security must be of a non-financial company;
•     the security may not be issued by an issuer currently in bankruptcy proceedings;
•     the security must have a minimum three-month average daily trading volume of at least 200,000 shares;
•     if the issuer of the security is organized under the laws of a jurisdiction outside the U.S., then such security must have listed options on a recognized options market in the U.S. or be

eligible for listed-options trading on a recognized options market in the U.S. (measured annually during the ranking review process);

•     the security must have an adjusted market capitalization equal to or exceeding 0.10% of the aggregate adjusted market capitalization of the NDX at each month-end. In the event a

company does not meet this criterion for two consecutive month-ends, it will be removed from the NDX effective after the close of trading on the third Friday of the following month; and

•     the issuer of the security may not have annual financial statements with an audit opinion that is currently withdrawn.

Computation of the NDX

The value of the NDX equals the aggregate value of the NDX share weights (the “NDX Shares”) of each of the NDX securities multiplied by each such security’s last sale price (last sale price refers to
the last sale price on NASDAQ), and divided by the divisor of the NDX. If trading in an NDX security is halted while the market is open, the last traded price for that security is used for all NDX
computations until trading resumes. If trading is halted before the market is open, the previous day’s last sale price is used. The formula for determining the NDX value is as follows:

The NDX is ordinarily calculated without regard to cash dividends on NDX securities. The NDX is calculated during the trading day and is disseminated once per second from 09:30:01 to 17:16:00 ET.
The closing level of the NDX may change up until 17:15:00 ET due to corrections to the last sale price of the NDX securities. The official closing value of the NDX is ordinarily disseminated at 17:16:00
ET.

NDX Maintenance

Changes to NDX Constituents

Changes to the NDX constituents may be made during the annual ranking review. In addition, if at any time during the year other than the annual review, it is determined that an NDX security issuer no
longer meets the criteria for continued inclusion in the NDX, or is otherwise determined to have become ineligible for continued inclusion in the NDX, it is replaced with the largest market capitalization
issuer not currently in the NDX that meets the applicable eligibility criteria for initial inclusion in the NDX.

Ordinarily, a security will be removed from the NDX at its last sale price. However, if at the time of its removal the NDX security is halted from trading on its primary listing market and an official closing
price cannot readily be determined, the NDX security may, in Nasdaq, Inc.’s discretion, be removed at a price of $0.00000001 (“zero price”). This zero price will be applied to the NDX security after the
close of the market but prior to the time the official closing value of the NDX is disseminated.

Divisor Adjustments

The divisor is adjusted to ensure that changes in the NDX constituents either by corporate actions (that adjust either the price or shares of an NDX security) or NDX participation outside of trading hours
do not affect the value of the NDX. All divisor changes occur after the close of the applicable index security markets.

Quarterly NDX Rebalancing

The NDX will be rebalanced on a quarterly basis if it is determined that (1) the current weight of the single NDX security with the largest market capitalization is greater than 24.0% of the NDX or (2) the
collective weight of those securities whose individual current weights are in excess of 4.5% exceeds 48.0% of the NDX. In addition, a “special rebalancing” of the NDX may be conducted at any time if
Nasdaq, Inc. determines it necessary to maintain the integrity and continuity of the NDX. If either one or both of the above weight distribution conditions are met upon quarterly review, or Nasdaq, Inc.
determines that a special rebalancing is necessary, a weight rebalancing will be performed.

If the first weight distribution condition is met and the current weight of the single NDX security with the largest market capitalization is greater than 24.0%, then the weights of all securities with current
weights greater than 1.0% (“large securities”) will be scaled down proportionately toward 1.0% until the adjusted weight of the single largest NDX security reaches 20.0%.

If the second weight distribution condition is met and the collective weight of those securities whose individual current weights are in excess of 4.5% (or adjusted weights in accordance with the
previous step, if applicable) exceeds 48.0% of the NDX, then the weights of all such large securities in that group will be scaled down proportionately toward 1.0% until their collective weight, so
adjusted, is equal to 40.0%.

The aggregate weight reduction among the large securities resulting from either or both of the rebalancing steps above will then be redistributed to those securities with weightings of less than 1.0%
(“small securities”) in the following manner. In the first iteration, the weight of the largest small security will be scaled upwards by a factor which sets it equal to the average NDX weight of 1.0%. The
weights of each of the smaller remaining small securities will be scaled up by the same factor reduced in relation to each security’s relative ranking among the small securities such that the smaller the
NDX security in the ranking, the less its weight will be scaled upward. This is intended to reduce the market impact of the weight rebalancing on the smallest component securities in the NDX.

In the second iteration of the small security rebalancing, the weight of the second largest small security, already adjusted in the first iteration, will be scaled upwards by a factor which sets it equal to the
average NDX weight of 1.0%. The weights of each of the smaller remaining small securities will be scaled up by this same factor reduced in relation to each security’s relative ranking among the small
securities such that, once again, the smaller the security in the ranking, the less its weight will be scaled upward. Additional iterations will be performed until the accumulated increase in weight among

the small securities equals the aggregate weight reduction among the large securities that resulted from the rebalancing in accordance with the two weight distribution conditions discussed above.

Finally, to complete the rebalancing process, once the final weighting percentages for each NDX security have been set, the NDX Shares will be determined anew based upon the last sale prices and
aggregate capitalization of the NDX at the close of trading on the last calendar day in February, May, August and November. Changes to the NDX Shares will be made effective after the close of trading
on the third Friday in March, June, September and December, and an adjustment to the divisor is made to ensure continuity of the NDX. Ordinarily, new rebalanced NDX Shares will be determined by
applying the above procedures to the current NDX Shares. However, Nasdaq, Inc. may, from time to time, determine rebalanced weights, if necessary, by applying the above procedure to the actual
current market capitalization of the NDX components. In such instances, Nasdaq, Inc. would announce the different basis for rebalancing prior to its implementation.

During the quarterly rebalancing, data is cutoff as of the previous month end and no changes are made to the NDX from that cutoff until the quarterly index share change effective date, except in the
case of changes due to corporate actions with an ex-date.

Adjustments for Corporate Actions

Changes in the price and/or NDX Shares driven by corporate events such as stock dividends, splits, and certain spin-offs and rights issuances will be adjusted on the ex-date. If the change in total
shares outstanding arising from other corporate actions is greater than or equal to 10.0%, the change will be made as soon as practicable. Otherwise, if the change in total shares outstanding is less
than 10.0%, then all such changes are accumulated and made effective at one time on a quarterly basis after the close of trading on the third Friday in each of March, June, September, and December.
The NDX Shares are derived from the security’s total shares outstanding. The NDX Shares are adjusted by the same percentage amount by which the total shares outstanding have changed.

Historical Performance of the NDX

The following graph sets forth the daily historical performance of the NDX in the period from January 2, 2019 through the pricing date. We obtained this historical data from Bloomberg L.P. We have not
independently verified the accuracy or completeness of the information obtained from Bloomberg L.P. On the pricing date, the closing level of the NDX was 17,526.80.

This historical data on the NDX is not necessarily indicative of the future performance of the NDX or what the value of the Notes may be. Any historical upward or downward trend in the closing level of
the NDX during any period set forth above is not an indication that the closing level of the NDX is more or less likely to increase or decrease at any time over the term of the Notes.

Before investing in the Notes, you should consult publicly available sources for the closing levels of the NDX.

Contingent Income Issuer Callable Yield Notes Linked to the Least Performing of the Nasdaq-100® Index, the Russell 2000® Index and the S&P 500® Index

The Russell 2000® Index

The RTY was developed by Russell Investments (“Russell”) before FTSE International Limited and Russell combined in 2015 to create FTSE Russell, which is wholly owned by London Stock Exchange
Group. Additional information on the RTY is available at the following website: http://www.ftserussell.com. No information on that website is deemed to be included or incorporated by reference in this
pricing supplement.

Russell began dissemination of the RTY on January 1, 1984. FTSE Russell calculates and publishes the RTY. The RTY was set to 135 as of the close of business on December 31, 1986. The RTY is
designed to track the performance of the small capitalization segment of the U.S. equity market. As a subset of the Russell 3000® Index, the RTY consists of the smallest 2,000 companies included in
the Russell 3000® Index. The Russell 3000® Index measures the performance of the largest 3,000 U.S. companies, representing approximately 98% of the investable U.S. equity market. The RTY is
determined, comprised, and calculated by FTSE Russell without regard to the Notes.

Selection of Stocks Comprising the RTY

Each company eligible for inclusion in the RTY must be classified as a U.S. company under FTSE Russell’s country-assignment methodology. If a company is incorporated, has a stated headquarters
location, and trades in the same country (American Depositary Receipts and American Depositary Shares are not eligible), then the company is assigned to its country of incorporation. If any of the
three factors are not the same, FTSE Russell defines three Home Country Indicators (“HCIs”): country of incorporation, country of headquarters, and country of the most liquid exchange (as defined by
a two-year average daily dollar trading volume) from all exchanges within a country. Using the HCIs, FTSE Russell compares the primary location of the company’s assets with the three HCIs. If the
primary location of its assets matches any of the HCIs, then the company is assigned to the primary location of its assets. If there is insufficient information to determine the country in which the
company’s assets are primarily located, FTSE Russell will use the country from which the company’s revenues are primarily derived for the comparison with the three HCIs in a similar manner. FTSE
Russell uses the average of two years of assets or revenues data to reduce potential turnover. If conclusive country details cannot be derived from assets or revenues data, FTSE Russell will assign
the company to the country of its headquarters, which is defined as the address of the company’s principal executive offices, unless that country is a Benefit Driven Incorporation (“BDI”) country, in
which case the company will be assigned to the country of its most liquid stock exchange. BDI countries include: Anguilla, Antigua and Barbuda, Bahamas, Barbados, Belize, Bermuda, Bonaire, British
Virgin Islands, Cayman Islands, Channel Islands, Cook Islands, Curacao, Faroe Islands, Gibraltar, Guernsey, Isle of Man, Jersey, Liberia, Marshall Islands, Panama, Saba, Sint Eustatius, Sint Maarten,
and Turks and Caicos Islands. For any companies incorporated or headquartered in a U.S. territory, including Puerto Rico, Guam, and U.S. Virgin Islands, a U.S. HCI is assigned.

All securities eligible for inclusion in the RTY must trade on a major U.S. exchange. Stocks must have a closing price at or above $1.00 on their primary exchange on the last trading day in May to be
eligible for inclusion during annual reconstitution. However, in order to reduce unnecessary turnover, if an existing member’s closing price is less than $1.00 on the last day of May, it will be considered
eligible if the average of the daily closing prices (from its primary exchange) during the month of May is equal to or greater than $1.00. Initial public offerings are added each quarter and must have a
closing price at or above $1.00 on the last day of their eligibility period in order to qualify for index inclusion. If an existing stock does not trade on the “rank day” (typically the last trading day in May but
a confirmed timetable is announced each spring) but does have a closing price at or above $1.00 on another eligible U.S. exchange, that stock will be eligible for inclusion.

An important criterion used to determine the list of securities eligible for the RTY is total market capitalization, which is defined as the market price as of the last trading day in May for those securities
being considered at annual reconstitution times the total number of shares outstanding. Where applicable, common stock, non-restricted exchangeable shares and partnership units/membership
interests are used to determine market capitalization. Any other form of shares such as preferred stock, convertible preferred stock, redeemable shares, participating preferred stock, warrants and
rights, installment receipts or trust receipts, are excluded from the calculation. If multiple share classes of common stock exist, they are combined. In cases where the common stock share classes act
independently of each other (e.g., tracking stocks), each class is considered for inclusion separately. If multiple share classes exist, the pricing vehicle will be designated as the share class with the
highest two-year trading volume as of the rank day in May.

Companies with a total market capitalization of less than $30 million are not eligible for the RTY. Similarly, companies with only 5% or less of their shares available in the marketplace are not eligible for
the RTY. Royalty trusts, limited liability companies, closed-end investment companies (companies that are required to report Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses, as defined by the SEC, including
business development companies), blank check companies, special purpose acquisition companies, and limited partnerships are also ineligible for inclusion. Bulletin board, pink sheets, and over-the-
counter traded securities are not eligible for inclusion. Exchange traded funds and mutual funds are also excluded.

Annual reconstitution is a process by which the RTY is completely rebuilt. Based on closing levels of the company’s common stock on its primary exchange on the rank day of May of each year, FTSE
Russell reconstitutes the composition of the RTY using the then existing market capitalizations of eligible companies. Reconstitution of the RTY occurs on the last Friday in June or, when the last Friday
in June is the 29th or 30th, reconstitution occurs on the prior Friday. In addition, FTSE Russell adds initial public offerings to the RTY on a quarterly basis based on total market capitalization ranking
within the market-adjusted capitalization breaks established during the most recent reconstitution. After membership is determined, a security’s shares are adjusted to include only those shares
available to the public. This is often referred to as “free float.” The purpose of the adjustment is to exclude from market calculations the capitalization that is not available for purchase and is not part of
the investable opportunity set.

Contingent Income Issuer Callable Yield Notes Linked to the Least Performing of the Nasdaq-100® Index, the Russell 2000® Index and the S&P 500® Index

The S&P 500® Index

The SPX includes a representative sample of 500 companies in leading industries of the U.S. economy. The SPX is intended to provide an indication of the pattern of common stock price movement.
The calculation of the level of the SPX is based on the relative value of the aggregate market value of the common stocks of 500 companies as of a particular time compared to the aggregate average
market value of the common stocks of 500 similar companies during the base period of the years 1941 through 1943.

The SPX includes companies from eleven main groups: Communication Services; Consumer Discretionary; Consumer Staples; Energy; Financials; Health Care; Industrials; Information Technology;
Real Estate; Materials; and Utilities. S&P Dow Jones Indices LLC (“SPDJI”), the sponsor of the SPX, may from time to time, in its sole discretion, add companies to, or delete companies from, the SPX
to achieve the objectives stated above.

Company additions to the SPX must have an unadjusted company market capitalization of $15.8 billion or more (an increase from the previous requirement of an unadjusted company market
capitalization of $14.5 billion or more).

SPDJI calculates the SPX by reference to the prices of the constituent stocks of the SPX without taking account of the value of dividends paid on those stocks. As a result, the return on the Notes will
not reflect the return you would realize if you actually owned the SPX constituent stocks and received the dividends paid on those stocks.

Computation of the SPX

While SPDJI currently employs the following methodology to calculate the SPX, no assurance can be given that SPDJI will not modify or change this methodology in a manner that may affect payments
on the Notes.

Historically, the market value of any component stock of the SPX was calculated as the product of the market price per share and the number of then outstanding shares of such component stock. In
March 2005, SPDJI began shifting the SPX halfway from a market capitalization weighted formula to a float-adjusted formula, before moving the SPX to full float adjustment on September 16, 2005.
SPDJI’s criteria for selecting stocks for the SPX did not change with the shift to float adjustment. However, the adjustment affects each company’s weight in the SPX.

Under float adjustment, the share counts used in calculating the SPX reflect only those shares that are available to investors, not all of a company’s outstanding shares. Float adjustment excludes
shares that are closely held by control groups, other publicly traded companies or government agencies.

In September 2012, all shareholdings representing more than 5% of a stock’s outstanding shares, other than holdings by “block owners,” were removed from the float for purposes of calculating the
SPX. Generally, these “control holders” will include officers and directors, private equity, venture capital and special equity firms, other publicly traded companies that hold shares for control, strategic
partners, holders of restricted shares, ESOPs, employee and family trusts, foundations associated with the company, holders of unlisted share classes of stock, government entities at all levels (other
than government retirement/pension funds) and any individual person who controls a 5% or greater stake in a company as reported in regulatory filings. However, holdings by block owners, such as
depositary banks, pension funds, mutual funds and ETF providers, 401(k) plans of the company, government retirement/pension funds, investment funds of insurance companies, asset managers and
investment funds, independent foundations and savings and investment plans, will ordinarily be considered part of the float.

Treasury stock, stock options, restricted shares, equity participation units, warrants, preferred stock, convertible stock, and rights are not part of the float. Shares held in a trust to allow investors in
countries outside the country of domicile, such as depositary shares and Canadian exchangeable shares, are normally part of the float unless those shares form a control block. If a company has
multiple classes of stock outstanding, shares in an unlisted or non-traded class are treated as a control block.

For each stock, an investable weight factor (“IWF”) is calculated by dividing the available float shares by the total shares outstanding. Available float shares are defined as the total shares outstanding
less shares held by control holders. This calculation is subject to a 5% minimum threshold for control blocks. For example, if a company’s officers and directors hold 3% of the company’s shares, and no
other control group holds 5% of the company’s shares, SPDJI would assign that company an IWF of 1.00, as no control group meets the 5% threshold. However, if a company’s officers and directors
hold 3% of the company’s shares and another control group holds 20% of the company’s shares, SPDJI would assign an IWF of 0.77, reflecting the fact that 23% of the company’s outstanding shares
are considered to be held for control. As of July 31, 2017, companies with multiple share class lines are no longer eligible for inclusion in the SPX. Constituents of the SPX prior to July 31, 2017 with
multiple share class lines will be grandfathered in and continue to be included in the SPX. If a constituent company of the SPX reorganizes into a multiple share class line structure, that company will
remain in the SPX at the discretion of the S&P Index Committee in order to minimize turnover.

The SPX is calculated using a base-weighted aggregate methodology. The level of the SPX reflects the total market value of all component stocks relative to the base period of the years 1941 through
1943. An indexed number is used to represent the results of this calculation in order to make the level easier to work with and track over time. The actual total market value of the component stocks
during the base period of the years 1941 through 1943 has been set to an indexed level of 10. This is often indicated by the notation 1941- 43 = 10. In practice, the daily calculation of the SPX is
computed by dividing the total market value of the component stocks by the “index divisor.” By itself, the index divisor is an arbitrary number. However, in the context of the calculation of the SPX, it
serves as a link to the original base period level of the SPX. The index divisor keeps the SPX comparable over time and is the manipulation point for all adjustments to the SPX, which is index
maintenance.

Index Maintenance

Index maintenance includes monitoring and completing the adjustments for company additions and deletions, share changes, stock splits, stock dividends, and stock price adjustments due to company
restructuring or spinoffs. Some corporate actions, such as stock splits and stock dividends, require changes in the common shares outstanding and the stock prices of the companies in the SPX, and
do not require index divisor adjustments.

To prevent the level of the SPX from changing due to corporate actions, corporate actions which affect the total market value of the SPX require an index divisor adjustment. By adjusting the index
divisor for the change in market value, the level of the SPX remains constant and does not reflect the corporate actions of individual companies in the SPX. Index divisor adjustments are made after the
close of trading and after the calculation of the SPX closing level.

Changes in a company’s shares outstanding of 5.00% or more due to mergers, acquisitions, public offerings, tender offers, Dutch auctions, or exchange offers are made as soon as reasonably
possible. Share changes due to mergers or acquisitions of publicly held companies that trade on a major exchange are implemented when the transaction occurs, even if both of the companies are not
in the same headline index, and regardless of the size of the change. All other changes of 5.00% or more (due to, for example, company stock repurchases, private placements, redemptions, exercise
of options, warrants, conversion of preferred stock, notes, debt, equity participation units, at-the-market offerings, or other recapitalizations) are made weekly and are announced on Fridays for
implementation after the close of trading on the following Friday. Changes of less than 5.00% are accumulated and made quarterly on the third Friday of March, June, September, and December, and
are usually announced two to five days prior.

If a change in a company’s shares outstanding of 5.00% or more causes a company’s IWF to change by five percentage points or more, the IWF is updated at the same time as the share change. IWF
changes resulting from partial tender offers are considered on a case by case basis.

Contingent Income Issuer Callable Yield Notes Linked to the Least Performing of the Nasdaq-100® Index, the Russell 2000® Index and the S&P 500® Index

Supplement to the Plan of Distribution; Role of BofAS and Conflicts of Interest

BofAS, a broker-dealer affiliate of ours, is a member of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. (“FINRA”) and will participate as selling agent in the distribution of the Notes. Accordingly, the
offering of the Notes will conform to the requirements of FINRA Rule 5121. BofAS may not make sales in this offering to any of its discretionary accounts without the prior written approval of the account
holder.

We will deliver the Notes against payment therefor in New York, New York on a date that is greater than two business days following the pricing date. Under Rule 15c6-1 of the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934, trades in the secondary market generally are required to settle in two business days, unless the parties to any such trade expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers who wish to trade
the Notes more than two business days prior to the original issue date will be required to specify alternative settlement arrangements to prevent a failed settlement.

Under our distribution agreement with BofAS, BofAS will purchase the Notes from us as principal at the public offering price indicated on the cover of this pricing supplement, less the indicated
underwriting discount, if any. BofAS will sell the Notes to other broker-dealers that will participate in the offering and that are not affiliated with us, at an agreed discount to the principal amount. Each of
those broker-dealers may sell the Notes to one or more additional broker-dealers. BofAS has informed us that these discounts may vary from dealer to dealer and that not all dealers will purchase or
repurchase the Notes at the same discount. Certain dealers who purchase the Notes for sale to certain fee-based advisory accounts may forgo some or all of their selling concessions, fees or
commissions. The public offering price for investors purchasing the Notes in these fee-based advisory accounts may be as low as $977.50 per $1,000.00 in principal amount of Notes.

BofAS and any of our other broker-dealer affiliates may use this pricing supplement and the accompanying product supplement, prospectus supplement and prospectus for offers and sales in
secondary market transactions and market-making transactions in the Notes. However, they are not obligated to engage in such secondary market transactions and/or market-making transactions.
These broker-dealer affiliates may act as principal or agent in these transactions, and any such sales will be made at prices related to prevailing market conditions at the time of the sale.

At BofAS’s discretion, for a short, undetermined initial period after the issuance of the Notes, BofAS may offer to buy the Notes in the secondary market at a price that may exceed the initial estimated
value of the Notes. Any price offered by BofAS for the Notes will be based on then-prevailing market conditions and other considerations, including the performance of the Underlyings and the
remaining term of the Notes. However, none of us, the Guarantor, BofAS or any of our other affiliates is obligated to purchase your Notes at any price or at any time, and we cannot assure you that any
party will purchase your Notes at a price that equals or exceeds the initial estimated value of the Notes.

Any price that BofAS may pay to repurchase the Notes will depend upon then prevailing market conditions, the creditworthiness of us and the Guarantor, and transaction costs. At certain times, this
price may be higher than or lower than the initial estimated value of the Notes.

European Economic Area and United Kingdom

None of this pricing supplement, the accompanying product supplement, the accompanying prospectus or the accompanying prospectus supplement is a prospectus for the purposes of the Prospectus
Regulation (as defined below). This pricing supplement, the accompanying product supplement, the accompanying prospectus and the accompanying prospectus supplement have been prepared on
the basis that any offer of Notes in any Member State of the European Economic Area (the “EEA”) or in the United Kingdom (each, a “Relevant State”) will only be made to a legal entity which is a
qualified investor under the Prospectus Regulation (“Qualified Investors”). Accordingly any person making or intending to make an offer in that Relevant State of Notes which are the subject of the
offering contemplated in this pricing supplement, the accompanying product supplement, the accompanying prospectus and the accompanying prospectus supplement may only do so with respect to
Qualified Investors. Neither BofA Finance nor BAC has authorized, nor does it authorize, the making of any offer of Notes other than to Qualified Investors. The expression “Prospectus Regulation”
means Regulation (EU) 2017/1129.

PROHIBITION OF SALES TO EEA AND UNITED KINGDOM RETAIL INVESTORS – The Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered, sold or
otherwise made available to any retail investor in the EEA or in the United Kingdom. For these purposes: (a) a retail investor means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in point
(11) of Article 4(1) of Directive 2014/65/EU, as amended (“MiFID II”); or (ii) a customer within the meaning of Directive (EU) 2016/97 (the Insurance Distribution Directive) where that customer would not
qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or (iii) not a qualified investor as defined in the Prospectus Regulation; and (b) the expression “offer” includes the
communication in any form and by any means of sufficient information on the terms of the offer and the Notes to be offered so as to enable an investor to decide to purchase or subscribe for the Notes.
Consequently no key information document required by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014, as amended (the “PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to
retail investors in the EEA or in the United Kingdom has been prepared and therefore offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the EEA or in the United
Kingdom may be unlawful under the PRIIPs Regulation.

Structuring the Notes

The Notes are our debt securities, the return on which is linked to the performance of the Underlyings. The related guarantee is BAC’s obligation. As is the case for all of our and BAC’s respective debt
securities, including our market-linked notes, the economic terms of the Notes reflect our and BAC’s actual or perceived creditworthiness at the time of pricing. In addition, because market-linked notes
result in increased operational, funding and liability management costs to us and BAC, BAC typically borrows the funds under these types of notes at a rate, which we refer to in this pricing supplement
as BAC’s internal funding rate, that is more favorable to BAC than the rate that it might pay for a conventional fixed or floating rate debt security. This generally relatively lower internal funding rate,
which is reflected in the economic terms of the Notes, along with the fees and charges associated with market-linked notes, resulted in the initial estimated value of the Notes on the pricing date being
less than their public offering price.

In order to meet our payment obligations on the Notes, at the time we issue the Notes, we may choose to enter into certain hedging arrangements (which may include call options, put options or other
derivatives) with BofAS or one of our other affiliates. The terms of these hedging arrangements are determined based upon terms provided by BofAS and its affiliates, and take into account a number of
factors, including our and BAC’s creditworthiness, interest rate movements, the volatility of the Underlyings, the tenor of the Notes and the hedging arrangements. The economic terms of the Notes and
their initial estimated value depend in part on the terms of these hedging arrangements.

BofAS has advised us that the hedging arrangements will include hedging related charges, reflecting the costs associated with, and our affiliates’ profit earned from, these hedging arrangements. Since
hedging entails risk and may be influenced by unpredictable market forces, actual profits or losses from these hedging transactions may be more or less than any expected amounts.

For further information, see “Risk Factors” beginning on page PS-5 and “Supplemental Use of Proceeds” on page PS-20 of the accompanying product supplement.

Validity of the Notes

In the opinion of McGuireWoods LLP, as counsel to BofA Finance, as issuer, and BAC, as guarantor, when the trustee has made the appropriate entries or notations on Schedule 1 to the master global
note that represents the Notes (the “Master Note”) identifying the Notes offered hereby as supplemental obligations thereunder in accordance with the instructions of BofA Finance, and the Notes have
been delivered against payment therefor as contemplated in this pricing supplement and the related prospectus, prospectus supplement and product supplement, all in accordance with the provisions
of the indenture governing the Notes and the related guarantee, such Notes will be the legal, valid and binding obligations of BofA Finance, and the related guarantee will be the legal, valid and binding
obligation of BAC, subject, in each case, to the effects of applicable bankruptcy, insolvency (including laws relating to preferences, fraudulent transfers and equitable subordination), reorganization,
moratorium and other similar laws affecting creditors’ rights generally, and to general principles of equity. This opinion is given as of the date of this pricing supplement and is limited to the Delaware
General Corporation Law and the Delaware Limited Liability Company Act (including the statutory provisions, all applicable provisions of the Delaware Constitution and reported judicial decisions
interpreting either of the foregoing) and the laws of the State of New York as in effect on the date hereof. In addition, this opinion is subject to customary assumptions about the trustee’s authorization,
execution and delivery of the indenture governing the Notes and due authentication of the Master Note, the validity, binding nature and enforceability of the indenture governing the Notes and the
related guarantee with respect to the trustee, the legal capacity of individuals, the genuineness of signatures, the authenticity of all documents submitted to McGuireWoods LLP as originals, the
conformity to original documents of all documents submitted to McGuireWoods LLP as copies thereof, the authenticity of the originals of such copies and certain factual matters, all as stated in the
opinion letter of McGuireWoods LLP dated December 8, 2022, which has been filed as an exhibit to the Registration Statement (File Nos. 333-268718 and 333-268718-01) of BAC and BofA Finance,
filed with the SEC on December 8, 2022.

Contingent Income Issuer Callable Yield Notes Linked to the Least Performing of the Nasdaq-100® Index, the Russell 2000® Index and the S&P 500® Index

U.S. Federal Income Tax Summary

The following summary of the material U.S. federal income and estate tax considerations of the acquisition, ownership, and disposition of the Notes supplements, and to the extent inconsistent
supersedes, the discussion under “U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations” in the accompanying prospectus and is not exhaustive of all possible tax considerations. This summary is based upon the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), regulations promulgated under the Code by the U.S. Treasury Department (“Treasury”) (including proposed and temporary regulations),
rulings, current administrative interpretations and official pronouncements of the IRS, and judicial decisions, all as currently in effect and all of which are subject to differing interpretations or to change,
possibly with retroactive effect. No assurance can be given that the IRS would not assert, or that a court would not sustain, a position contrary to any of the tax consequences described below. This
summary does not include any description of the tax laws of any state or local governments, or of any foreign government, that may be applicable to a particular holder.

Although the Notes are issued by us, they will be treated as if they were issued by BAC for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Accordingly throughout this tax discussion, references to “we,” “our” or “us”
are generally to BAC unless the context requires otherwise.

This summary is directed solely to U.S. Holders and Non-U.S. Holders that, except as otherwise specifically noted, will purchase the Notes upon original issuance and will hold the Notes as capital
assets within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Code, which generally means property held for investment, and that are not excluded from the discussion under “U.S. Federal Income Tax
Considerations” in the accompanying prospectus.

You should consult your own tax advisor concerning the U.S. federal income tax consequences to you of acquiring, owning, and disposing of the Notes, as well as any tax consequences arising under
the laws of any state, local, foreign, or other tax jurisdiction and the possible effects of changes in U.S. federal or other tax laws.

General

Although there is no statutory, judicial, or administrative authority directly addressing the characterization of the Notes, we intend to treat the Notes for all tax purposes as contingent income-bearing
single financial contracts with respect to the Underlyings and under the terms of the Notes, we and every investor in the Notes agree, in the absence of an administrative determination or judicial ruling
to the contrary, to treat the Notes in accordance with such characterization. In the opinion of our counsel, Sidley Austin LLP, it is reasonable to treat the Notes as contingent income-bearing single
financial contracts with respect to the Underlyings. However, Sidley Austin LLP has advised us that it is unable to conclude that it is more likely than not that this treatment will be upheld. This discussion
assumes that the Notes constitute contingent income-bearing single financial contracts with respect to the Underlyings for U.S. federal income tax purposes. If the Notes did not constitute contingent
income-bearing single financial contracts, the tax consequences described below would be materially different.

This characterization of the Notes is not binding on the IRS or the courts. No statutory, judicial, or administrative authority directly addresses the characterization of the Notes or any similar instruments
for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and no ruling is being requested from the IRS with respect to their proper characterization and treatment. Due to the absence of authorities on point, significant
aspects of the U.S. federal income tax consequences of an investment in the Notes are not certain, and no assurance can be given that the IRS or any court will agree with the characterization and tax
treatment described in this pricing supplement. Accordingly, you are urged to consult your tax advisor regarding all aspects of the U.S. federal income tax consequences of an investment in the Notes,
including possible alternative characterizations.

Unless otherwise stated, the following discussion is based on the characterization described above. The discussion in this section assumes that there is a significant possibility of a significant loss of
principal on an investment in the Notes.

We will not attempt to ascertain whether any issuer of a component stock included in an Underlying would be treated as a “passive foreign investment company” (“PFIC”), within the meaning of Section
1297 of the Code, or a United States real property holding corporation, within the meaning of Section 897(c) of the Code. If the issuer of one or more stocks included in an Underlying were so treated,
certain adverse U.S. federal income tax consequences could possibly apply to a holder of the Notes. You should refer to information filed with the SEC by the issuers of the component stocks included
in each Underlying and consult your tax advisor regarding the possible consequences to you, if any, if any issuer of a component stock included in an Underlying is or becomes a PFIC or is or becomes
a United States real property holding corporation.

U.S. Holders

Although the U.S. federal income tax treatment of any Contingent Coupon Payment on the Notes is uncertain, we intend to take the position, and the following discussion assumes, that any Contingent
Coupon Payment constitutes taxable ordinary income to a U.S. Holder at the time received or accrued in accordance with the U.S. Holder’s regular method of accounting. By purchasing the Notes you
agree, in the absence of an administrative determination or judicial ruling to the contrary, to treat any Contingent Coupon Payment as described in the preceding sentence.

Upon receipt of a cash payment at maturity or upon a sale, exchange, or redemption of the Notes prior to maturity, a U.S. Holder generally will recognize capital gain or loss equal to the difference
between the amount realized (other than amounts representing any Contingent Coupon Payment, which would be taxed as described above) and the U.S. Holder’s tax basis in the Notes. A U.S.
Holder’s tax basis in the Notes will equal the amount paid by that holder to acquire them. This capital gain or loss generally will be long-term capital gain or loss if the U.S. Holder held the Notes for
more than one year. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations.

Alternative Tax Treatments. Due to the absence of authorities that directly address the proper tax treatment of the Notes, prospective investors are urged to consult their tax advisors regarding all
possible alternative tax treatments of an investment in the Notes. In particular, the IRS could seek to subject the Notes to the Treasury regulations governing contingent payment debt instruments. If the
IRS were successful in that regard, the timing and character of income on the Notes would be affected significantly. Among other things, a U.S. Holder would be required to accrue original issue
discount every year at a “comparable yield” determined at the time of issuance. In addition, any gain realized by a U.S. Holder at maturity or upon a sale, exchange, or redemption of the Notes
generally would be treated as ordinary income, and any loss realized at maturity or upon a sale, exchange, or redemption of the Notes generally would be treated as ordinary loss to the extent of the
U.S. Holder’s prior accruals of original issue discount, and as capital loss thereafter.

In addition, it is possible that the Notes could be treated as a unit consisting of a deposit and a put option written by the Note holder, in which case the timing and character of income on the Notes
would be affected significantly.

The IRS released Notice 2008-2 (the "Notice"), which sought comments from the public on the taxation of financial instruments currently taxed as “prepaid forward contracts.” This Notice addresses
instruments such as the Notes. According to the Notice, the IRS and Treasury are considering whether a holder of an instrument such as the Notes should be required to accrue ordinary income on a
current basis, regardless of whether any payments are made prior to maturity. It is not possible to determine what guidance the IRS and Treasury will ultimately issue, if any. Any such future guidance
may affect the amount, timing and character of income, gain, or loss in respect of the Notes, possibly with retroactive effect.

The IRS and Treasury are also considering additional issues, including whether additional gain or loss from such instruments should be treated as ordinary or capital, whether foreign holders of such
instruments should be subject to withholding tax on any deemed income accruals, whether Section 1260 of the Code, concerning certain “constructive ownership transactions,” generally applies or
should generally apply to such instruments, and whether any of these determinations depend on the nature of the underlying asset.

In addition, proposed Treasury regulations require the accrual of income on a current basis for contingent payments made under certain notional principal contracts. The preamble to the regulations
states that the “wait and see” method of accounting does not properly reflect the economic accrual of income on those contracts, and requires current accrual of income for some contracts already in
existence. While the proposed regulations do not apply to prepaid forward contracts, the preamble to the proposed regulations expresses the view that similar timing issues exist in the case of prepaid
forward contracts. If the IRS or Treasury publishes future guidance requiring current economic accrual for contingent payments on prepaid forward contracts, it is possible that you could be required to
accrue income over the term of the Notes.

Because of the absence of authority regarding the appropriate tax characterization of the Notes, it is also possible that the IRS could seek to characterize the Notes in a manner that results in tax
consequences that are different from those described above. For example, the IRS could possibly assert that any gain or loss that a holder may recognize at maturity or upon the sale, exchange, or
redemption of the Notes should be treated as ordinary gain or loss.

Because each Underlying is an index that periodically rebalances, it is possible that the Notes could be treated as a series of contingent income-bearing single financial contracts, each of which
matures on the next rebalancing date. If the Notes were properly characterized in such a manner, a U.S. Holder would be treated as disposing of the Notes on each rebalancing date in return for new
Notes that mature on the next rebalancing date, and a U.S. Holder would accordingly likely recognize capital gain or loss on each rebalancing date equal to the difference between the holder’s tax basis
in the Notes (which would be adjusted to take into account any prior recognition of gain or loss) and the fair market value of the Notes on such date.

Non-U.S. Holders

Because the U.S. federal income tax treatment of the Notes (including any Contingent Coupon Payment) is uncertain, we (or the applicable paying agent) will withhold U.S. federal income tax at a 30%
rate (or at a lower rate under an applicable income tax treaty) on the entire amount of any Contingent Coupon Payment made unless such payments are effectively connected with the conduct by the
Non-U.S. Holder of a trade or business in the U.S. (in which case, to avoid withholding, the Non-U.S. Holder will be required to provide a Form W-8ECI). We (or the applicable paying agent) will not pay
any additional amounts in respect of such withholding. To claim benefits under an income tax treaty, a Non-U.S. Holder must obtain a taxpayer identification number and certify as to its eligibility under
the appropriate treaty’s limitations on benefits article, if applicable. In addition, special rules may apply to claims for treaty benefits made by Non-U.S. Holders that are entities rather than individuals.
The availability of a lower rate of withholding under an applicable income tax treaty will depend on whether such rate applies to the characterization of the payments under U.S. federal income tax laws.
A Non-U.S. Holder that is eligible for a reduced rate of U.S. federal withholding tax pursuant to an income tax treaty may obtain a refund of any excess amounts withheld by filing an appropriate claim
for refund with the IRS.

Except as discussed below, a Non-U.S. Holder generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income or withholding tax for amounts paid in respect of the Notes (not including, for the avoidance of doubt,
amounts representing any Contingent Coupon Payment which would be subject to the rules discussed in the previous paragraph) upon the sale, exchange, or redemption of the Notes or their
settlement at maturity, provided that the Non-U.S. Holder complies with applicable certification requirements and that the payment is not effectively connected with the conduct by the Non-U.S. Holder
of a U.S. trade or business. Notwithstanding the foregoing, gain from the sale, exchange, or redemption of the Notes or their settlement at maturity may be subject to U.S. federal income tax if that Non-
U.S. Holder is a non-resident alien individual and is present in the U.S. for 183 days or more during the taxable year of the sale, exchange, redemption, or settlement and certain other conditions are
satisfied.

If a Non-U.S. Holder of the Notes is engaged in the conduct of a trade or business within the U.S. and if any Contingent Coupon Payment and gain realized on the settlement at maturity, or upon sale,
exchange, or redemption of the Notes, is effectively connected with the conduct of such trade or business (and, if certain tax treaties apply, is attributable to a permanent establishment maintained by
the Non-U.S. Holder in the U.S.), the Non-U.S. Holder, although exempt from U.S. federal withholding tax, generally will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on such Contingent Coupon Payment and
gain on a net income basis in the same manner as if it were a U.S. Holder. Such Non-U.S. Holders should read the material under the heading “—U.S. Holders,” for a description of the U.S. federal
income tax consequences of acquiring, owning, and disposing of the Notes. In addition, if such Non-U.S. Holder is a foreign corporation, it may also be subject to a branch profits tax equal to 30% (or
such lower rate provided by any applicable tax treaty) of a portion of its earnings and profits for the taxable year that are effectively connected with its conduct of a trade or business in the U.S., subject
to certain adjustments.

A “dividend equivalent” payment is treated as a dividend from sources within the United States and such payments generally would be subject to a 30% U.S. withholding tax if paid to a Non-U.S. Holder.
Under Treasury regulations, payments (including deemed payments) with respect to equity-linked instruments (“ELIs”) that are “specified ELIs” may be treated as dividend equivalents if such specified
ELIs reference an interest in an “underlying security,” which is generally any interest in an entity taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes if a payment with respect to such interest
could give rise to a U.S. source dividend. However, IRS guidance provides that withholding on dividend equivalent payments will not apply to specified ELIs that are not delta-one instruments and that
are issued before January 1, 2025. Based on our determination that the Notes are not delta-one instruments, Non-U.S. Holders should not be subject to withholding on dividend equivalent payments, if
any, under the Notes. However, it is possible that the Notes could be treated as deemed reissued for U.S. federal income tax purposes upon the occurrence of certain events affecting the Underlyings
or the Notes, and following such occurrence the Notes could be treated as subject to withholding on dividend equivalent payments. Non-U.S. Holders that enter, or have entered, into other transactions
in respect of the Underlyings or the Notes should consult their tax advisors as to the application of the dividend equivalent withholding tax in the context of the Notes and their other transactions. If any
payments are treated as dividend equivalents subject to withholding, we (or the applicable paying agent) would be entitled to withhold taxes without being required to pay any additional amounts with
respect to amounts so withheld.

As discussed above, alternative characterizations of the Notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes are possible. Should an alternative characterization, by reason of change or clarification of the law,
by regulation or otherwise, cause payments as to the Notes to become subject to withholding tax in addition to the withholding tax described above, tax will be withheld at the applicable statutory rate.
Prospective Non-U.S. Holders should consult their own tax advisors regarding the tax consequences of such alternative characterizations.

U.S. Federal Estate Tax. Under current law, while the matter is not entirely clear, individual Non-U.S. Holders, and entities whose property is potentially includible in those individuals’ gross estates for
U.S. federal estate tax purposes (for example, a trust funded by such an individual and with respect to which the individual has retained certain interests or powers), should note that, absent an
applicable treaty benefit, a Note is likely to be treated as U.S. situs property, subject to U.S. federal estate tax. These individuals and entities should consult their own tax advisors regarding the U.S.
federal estate tax consequences of investing in a Note.

Backup Withholding and Information Reporting

Please see the discussion under “U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations — General — Backup Withholding and Information Reporting” in the accompanying prospectus for a description of the
applicability of the backup withholding and information reporting rules to payments made on the Notes.
